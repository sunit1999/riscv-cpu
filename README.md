# [CS61CPU](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa20/projects/proj3/)
- Create Individual sub-circuits: ALU, Branch Comparison, Immediate Generation etc.
- Wire those sub-circuits together as per RISC V specfication to create a basic RISC-V CPU.
- Introduced a 2-stage Pipeline to improve throughput: Instruction Fetch (IF) and Instruction Execute (EX).
- Capable of handling operations such as Arithmetic, Logic, Loads, Stores and Branches.
